# Rudderstack Schema Compare Sheet

If you need to get all of the your dataplanes' schema versions in one place and find out how many versions are currently active, this sheet can help you out.
👀Look to the top of this screen and you will see a new option in the toolbar 👆 - Scripts

This toolbar contains two options...

1️⃣ Get all event models - This calls Rudderstack's API and gets all of the event models for the dataplane you selected in the control panel above. 
The results are displayed in the event-models sheet 📃 in this document.

2️⃣ Get schema - This runs down the list of your event models, calls Rudderstack's API for each one, before printing them all to a new sheet. 
Make sure you have the sheet id 🔍 of your copy of the template in the control panel above to make sure that you have the scripts to easily analyse the results. 
The results will be saved to the folder 📂you designated in the control panel above.

👩‍💻 In your newly-created schema document, you will see all of the versions for your event models next to each other, with one sheet per event model.
To easily analyse these results, you can run the two scripts in the workbook. This new file also has a 👆 Scripts menu in the toolbar.
